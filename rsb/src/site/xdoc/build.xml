        <section name="Prerequisites">
          <ul>
          <li>Sun/Oracle JDK 1.6</li>
          <li>Maven 3</li>
          </ul>

          <p>To produce rsb.war, run:
            <source>
mvn clean install
            </source></p>
          <p>Note that this war embeds javax dependencies and is designed to be deployed on web containers (like Tomcat or Jetty).</p>
          <p>To produce a rsb.war that can be deployed on application servers, run:
            <source>
mvn -P-javax-dependencies clean install
            </source></p>
        </section>
        <section name="Packaged Distribution">
            <p>To build a complete distribution consisting of Tomcat with both the RPooli and RSB web application deployed in it, run:
                <source>
mvn -Pjavax-dependencies,tomcat-distribution clean package
                </source>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="Test Run">
            <p>On Linux/OS X, you can easily start RSB for a quick ride with:
            <source>
mvn jetty:run
            </source>
            to start RSB configured to use a locally running RPooli.
            </p>
            <p>Similarly, if you have a locally running RPooli, it's also possible to quickly try RSB with Tomcat by running:
            <source>
mvn -Pjavax-dependencies,tomcat cargo:run
            </source>
            Press Control+C when you'll be done with testing.
            </p>
            <p>In both cases, RSB is accessible at this URL: <a href="http://localhost:8888/rsb">http://localhost:8888/rsb</a></p>
        </section>
        <section name="Integration Tests">
            <p>RPooli must be running locally before starting the integration tests.</p>
            <p>If that is the case, then run:
                <source>
mvn -Pjavax-dependencies,it clean verify
                </source>
            </p>
